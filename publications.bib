  abstract = {Functional harmony is an integral part of many repertoires in the Western musical practices, including both diatonic and extended tonality. In the latter context, music-theoretical accounts suggest that the three octatonic equivalence classes (OECs) consisting of pitch-classes related by stacked minor-third intervals may be associated with tonic (T), dominant (D), and subdominant (S) functions. Whether this theoretical description of music is also relevant to the perception of music has not yet been tested empirically. In this study, 100 participants familiar with Western repertoires were presented with jazz chord progressions containing chord substitutions. When each stimulus had been played, participants predicted how many more chords they would have expected to hear before the progression could reach a plausible conclusion. We computed the similarity of responses for pairs of stimuli containing different harmonic substitutions and modeled such similarity values based on different measures of harmonic relatedness between substitutions. Data show that the OEC membership of substitutions strongly predicts the similarity of participants? completion ratings. Bayesian mixed-effects modeling of similarity values further showed a categorical distinction between D and S as functional categories, on one hand, and T, on the other hand. The data also appear to reflect the prevalent influence of rock and pop repertoires on the participants, encouraging further research into the influence of stylistic diversity and musical expertise. Overall, results contribute to the characterization of listeners? implicit knowledge of the principles of harmonic structure in extended tonality and support the relevance of OECs not only as descriptors of extended-tonal compositional practices but also parsimonious predictors of perceived functionality.},

  abstract = {Music is a fascinating and complex aspect of cognition. When listening to music, listeners may experience complex structural relations, many of which are characterized in great detail by music-theoretical accounts. Such cognitive experience of structure in music, however, presents many challenges for empirical investigation: structural interpretations are the result of an inference on the part of the listener, resulting in ambiguous interpretations that listeners cannot often report explicitly. As a comparison, language comprehenders are also sensitive to the syntactic structure of sentences, and psycholinguistic research has an extensive track-record in investigating what representations of syntactic structure look like, and how they are formed in real-time processing. Could we achieve a similar understanding for music too? The goal of the symposium is to reflect on the challenges and prospects of such an endeavour: What can we learn from behavioural and brain-imaging experiments about the cognitive reality of musical structures? How do empirical observations pertaining to prediction and processing complexity relate to theoretical frameworks of musical structure?},

  abstract = {Voice leading is considered to play an important role in the structure of Western tonal music. However, the explicit voice assignment of a piece (if present at all) generally does not reflect all phenomena related to voice leading. Instead, voice-leading phenomena can occur in free textures (e.g., in most keyboard music), or cut across the explicitly notated voices (e.g., through implicit polyphony within a single voice). This paper presents a model of proto-voices, voice-like structures that encode sequential and vertical relations between notes without the need to assume explicit voices. Proto-voices are constructed by recursive combination of primitive structural operations, such as insertion of neighbor or passing notes, or horizontalization of simultaneous notes. Together, these operations give rise to a grammar-like hierarchical system that can be used to infer the structural fabric of a piece using a chart parsing algorithm. Such a model can serve as a foundation for defining higher-level latent entities (such as harmonies or voice-leading schemata), explicitly linking them to their realizations on the musical surface.},

  abstract = {Hierarchical models of music allow explanation of highly complex musical structure based on the general principle of recursive elaboration and a small set of orthogonal operations. Recent approaches to melodic elaboration have converged to a representation based on intervals, which allows the elaboration of pairs of notes. However, two problems remain: First, an interval-first representation obscures one-sided operations like neighbor notes. Second, while models of Western melody styles largely agree on step-wise operations such as neighbors and passing notes, larger intervals are either attributed to latent harmonic properties or left unexplained. This paper presents a grammar for melodies in North Indian raga music, showing not only that recursively applied neighbor and passing note operations underlie this style as well, but that larger intervals are generated as generalized neighbors, based on the tonal hierarchy of the underlying scale structure. The notion of a generalized neighbor is not restricted to ragas but can be transferred to other musical styles, opening new perspectives on latent structure behind melodies and music in general. The presented grammar is based on a graph representation that allows one to express elaborations on both notes and intervals, unifying and generalizing previous graph- and tree-based approaches.},

This paper tackles the problem of recognizing voice-leading schemata in polyphonic music.Since schema types and subtypes can be realized in a wide variety of ways on the musical surface,finding schemata in an automated fashion is a challenging task.To perform schema inference we employ a skipgram model that computes schema candidates, which are then classified using a binary classifier on musical features related to pitch and rhythm.This model is evaluated on a novel dataset of schema annotations in Mozart's piano sonatas produced byexpert annotators, which is published alongside this paper.The features are chosen to encode music-theoretically predicted properties of schema instances.We assess the relevance of each feature for the classification task, thus contributing to the theoretical understanding of complex musical objects.},

  abstract = {Music is highly complex and provides a rich variety of insights into the human mind, its mental structures, and processes. Experienced musicians are able to create complex structures in real time effortlessly, yet there is at present no successful model of full musical structure. The integration of different musical aspects such as melody, rhythm, voice leading, and form as well as the representation of long-term structure are particularly challenging. To open new possibilities for the study of higher-order structure in music and its perceptual correlates, cognitive music research would benefit from further mutual integration of theoretical, mathematical, computational, and psychological research, similar to advancements in linguistics. This symposium therefore focuses on the formal understanding and empirical investigation of music-theoretically motivated research questions in music cognition. It connects perspectives from music theory, behavioral research, corpus research, and computational modeling, and aims to initiate interdisciplinary discussions about the currently most challenging topics related to the cognition of higher-order structures in music.},

  abstract = {Studies in psycho-linguistics have provided compelling evidence that theoretical syntactic structures have cognitive correlates that inform and influence language perception. Generative grammar models also present a principled way to represent a plethora of hierarchical structures outside the domain of language. Hierarchical aspects of musical structure, in particular, are often described through grammar models. Whether such models carry perceptual relevance in music, however, requires further study. To address the descriptive adequacy of a grammar model in music, unfamiliar musical phrases consisting of chord progressions within the Jazz idiom were used, and zero to three chords were cut from the end of each phrase. A total of 150 participants were then presented with these stimuli and asked to provide a Closure Response, that is to predict how many more chords (0, 1, 2, or 3) were expected before the chord progression was complete. Simultaneously, a grammar model of hierarchical structure as well as a bigram model were trained over a corpus of 150 expert-annotated Jazz tunes. The models were then used to estimate probability distributions of Closure Responses in the stimuli presented to the participants. Bayesian mixed-effects models reveal that the models carry predictive value for the participants' response distributions and that the hierarchical model contains incremental predictive information over the bigram model. The present results suggest that -- akin to language -- hierarchical relationships between musical events have a cognitive correlate, which influences the perception and interpretation of music.},
